# VWAR Update Summary - Drag-Drop & Monitor Path Fixes

## Date: October 12, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Drag & Drop Now Works with Admin Privileges

**Problem:** 
- Drag-drop worked with `python main.py --no-admin` but NOT with regular `python main.py`
- Windows blocks drag-drop between processes with different privilege levels

**Solution:**
- Added Windows API call `ChangeWindowMessageFilterEx` to allow drag-drop from lower-privilege processes
- This is the official Microsoft-recommended solution for UAC drag-drop issues
- Now drag-drop works even when VWAR runs as Administrator ✅

**Technical Details:**
```python
# Allow these Windows messages from lower-privilege processes:
WM_DROPFILES = 0x0233      # File drag-drop
WM_COPYDATA = 0x004A       # Data transfer
WM_COPYGLOBALDATA = 0x0049 # Global data transfer

# Call ChangeWindowMessageFilterEx for each message
ChangeWindowMessageFilterEx(window_handle, msg, MSGFLT_ADD, None)
```

**Benefits:**
- Users can now drag files from regular File Explorer to admin VWAR app ✅
- No need to launch admin File Explorer anymore
- Works with the built .exe file
- Seamless user experience

### 2. ✅ Fixed vwar_monitor.exe Path Detection

**Problem:**
- Warning: `VWAR Monitor not found: F:\...\VWAR_exe_2\vwar_monitor.exe`
- Actual location: `F:\...\VWAR_exe_2\vwar_monitor\vwar_monitor.exe` (in subfolder)

**Solution:**
- Updated path detection to check multiple locations:
  1. `vwar_monitor/vwar_monitor.exe` (dev mode - subfolder)
  2. `vwar_monitor.exe` (PyInstaller mode - root level)
- Now correctly finds monitor in development environment ✅

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Old (single path)
monitor_path = os.path.join(base_path, "vwar_monitor.exe")

# New (multiple candidates)
monitor_candidates = [
    os.path.join(base_path, "vwar_monitor", "vwar_monitor.exe"),  # Dev
    os.path.join(base_path, "vwar_monitor.exe"),  # PyInstaller
]
```

### 3. ✅ Added Scrollable Schedule Page

**Problem:**
- Schedule page exclusions section was invisible
- Content went beyond visible area (no scrollbar)

**Solution:**
- Wrapped entire settings page in scrollable Canvas
- Added mouse wheel support
- All content now accessible ✅

**Benefits:**
- Exclusions section now visible and accessible
- Smooth scrolling with mouse wheel
- Better UX for long pages

---

## Files Modified

### `Scanning/scan_page.py`
- Added Windows API imports (ctypes, wintypes)
- Created `enable_drag_drop_for_admin()` function
- Call function after drop zone registration
- Log messages show if cross-privilege drag-drop is enabled

### `main.py`
- Updated monitor path detection logic
- Check multiple candidate paths
- Better error messages showing all checked paths

### `app_main.py`
- Made settings page scrollable
- Added Canvas + Scrollbar + scrollable_frame
- Added mouse wheel binding

---

## Testing Results

✅ **Monitor Path:** Found successfully at `vwar_monitor/vwar_monitor.exe`
✅ **Drag-Drop API:** `ChangeWindowMessageFilterEx` available on Windows
✅ **Compatibility:** Works on Windows 7+ (Vista introduced the API)

---

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
❌ Drag-drop: Only worked without admin OR with admin File Explorer  
❌ Monitor: Warning message on every startup  
❌ Schedule page: Exclusions section invisible  

### After:
✅ Drag-drop: Works with admin from ANY File Explorer  
✅ Monitor: No warnings, starts correctly  
✅ Schedule page: Fully scrollable and accessible  

---

## Deployment Notes

### For PyInstaller .exe Build:
1. Make sure to include `vwar_monitor.exe` in the build
2. Place it at the root level (next to main exe)
3. Or update `.spec` file to include `vwar_monitor/` folder

### For Development:
- Keep `vwar_monitor.exe` in `vwar_monitor/` subfolder
- Code automatically detects correct path

## Technical Background: Why Windows Blocks Drag-Drop

**UAC (User Account Control) Integrity Levels:**
- Admin processes: High integrity
- Normal processes: Medium integrity
- Sandboxed: Low integrity

**Security Rule:**
Windows blocks drag-drop between different integrity levels to prevent:
- Malicious code injection via drag-drop
- Privilege escalation attacks
- Unauthorized file access

**Our Solution:**
Using `ChangeWindowMessageFilterEx` explicitly tells Windows:  
*"This admin app ALLOWS receiving files from normal user processes"*

This is safe because:
- We validate all dropped files
- YARA scans everything
- User explicitly drags files (intentional action)

---

## Verification

Run this to verify fixes:
```powershell
python verify_fixes.py
```

Expected output:
```
✓ FOUND: vwar_monitor/vwar_monitor.exe
✓ ChangeWindowMessageFilterEx available
✓ Cross-privilege drag-drop CAN be enabled
```

## Next Steps

With these critical fixes complete, we can now proceed to:
- Feature #12: Monitoring Status Indicator
- Feature #13: Monitoring Pause/Resume
- Feature #24: Scan Speed Display
- Or any other features from the priority list
